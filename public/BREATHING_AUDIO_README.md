BREATHING AUDIO NOTE

For the full experience, you'll need to add a breathing audio file.

Place an MP3 file named "breathing.mp3" in the /public folder.

You can:
1. Record slow, rhythmic breathing (in for 4 seconds, out for 6 seconds)
2. Use a low-frequency binaural breathing track
3. Find royalty-free breathing meditation audio

The audio should:
- Be low-frequency and calming
- Loop seamlessly
- Have a slow, deliberate rhythm (around 6-8 breaths per minute)
- Duration: 30-60 seconds for smooth looping

Alternatively, you can generate this with:
- Text-to-speech with breathing sounds
- Audio synthesis tools
- Free meditation/ASMR audio libraries
